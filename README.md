# **Text Adventure Game: A Knight's End**

This Text Adventure Game was project for my Intro to Programming class at Udacity. It is supposed to use basic Python knowledge including
if and else statements. It has a variety of secret items, secret areas, a secret boss, and also four separate endings that happen depending
on what items the player has accumulated or how much they have explored the story. It also has a small economy system with gold that the player can earn
and spend on items at a shop.

This is the first game and also major project I have ever worked on and it is inspired by older Japanese Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy.
I hope you enjoy!
